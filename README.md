**Vision Statement:** The library database product was assigned to our team by our Professor Hossein Saiedian in EECS 447 (Introduction to Database Systems) as a semester-long exercise experience. 

**Scope Statement:** From the project overview: This project aims to provide hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and managing a relational database system for a small library. The system will manage a diverse collection of loanable items, track various types of memberships, enforce borrowing rules, and generate meaningful reports.
